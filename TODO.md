  - https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/solutions/role-based-access
- [ ] Have not tested the Google Login yet --> I think Long doing this
- [ ] Work out the security of route between pages --> Ensure user does not over-extend their access to different pages --> References:
  - https://daily.dev/blog/authentication-in-nextjs --> got the basics
- [X] Change testsite to something else --> right now it acts as a dashboard/index
- [ ] Right now, the calendar takes a while to render --> Have to optimise it or use other thing instead of MUI
- [ ] Add Location Search Bar
- [X] Put down the base of the add new booking: add session list and session info
